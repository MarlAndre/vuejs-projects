## Monster Slayer

### How to play

Each turn, the player can choose between a few actions:

* Attack: deals between 5 to 12 damage points to the monster
* Special attack: deals between 10 to 25 damage points to the monster, but is only available every 3 turns
* Healing: heals between 5 to 20 health points to the player
* Surrender: the monster will win 

Regardless of which action the player choses - with the exception of 'Surrender' - the monster will attack the player and deal between 10 to 25 damage points.

The player can restart a new game if they lose, win or if it's a draw.
